# standardbusinessplusneuralnets

This is a suite of neural network tools, AI (artificial intelligence) tools like ChatGPT, StableDiffusion, etc that have been modified with user interfaces, and other functionality that makes them extremely useful for standard businesses.

The goal is to add value to standard (or even 'Boring') businesses such as: House Cleaning, HVAC repair/maintenance, Pool Cleaning, etc.

The added value could be:
1. Time saved.
2. Replace part of an employee's duties, freeing employee up for other work.
3. Gold stars - added functionality that makes your business stand out.

Some potential standard software needs may fall in these categories:
1. Automated quoting.
2. Automated followup to interest requests, quote requests, jobs, etc.
3. Templates: quoting, invoicing, etc.
4. 24/7 customer service in forms of: voice (phone), web chat, texting.
5. Scheduling, and supply chain delivery time visibility.
